Revisiting this origin concept. I'm going to be cutting out the new android content, and changing the datapack to instead focus on Zombies only.

Planned Origins

Basic Zombie Origin
	A Challenge-based origin, where the player's end goal is to cure themselves. Weaker than a normal origin.
Infected Origin
	Variation of the Basic Zombie Origin. Starts as infected, turns into Zombie when killed. Can be cured to return back to infected.
Drowned Origin
	Aquatic based Zombie Origin
Husk Origin
	Zombie Origin with less sunlight debuffs and maybe some other powers?
Convertible Zombie Origin
	Can change between Drowned/Husk based on Enviromental Factors
Mycelium Zombie Origin
	Zombie With mushroom powers
Vessel Origin
	Zombie with soul/allay powers

And potential for
	NetherWart, Crimson, Warped, Sculk, Withered variants

POWER STATUS
Updates:
Sunlight Sensitivity
	Updated into vanilla and normal variants. Will possibly make a husk specific one later?
Outcast, Passive Zombie - Same.

Still Outdated
Cureable -> Easy and hard variant?
Flavour
MiningBuff
Nonaquatic -> Regular and Drowned version?
Scraps
Souldeath
spawnpoint
testpowers
vessel
vesselhealth
zombify

===================================================
PREVIOUS ORIGIN STATUS

Vessel (Evolution of Mycelium Zombie Concept)

POWERS
	Vessel - Night Vision, Zombie group abilities
	Astral Projection
	Sunlight - burn in daylight, exponential, helmet
	Vessel Health - Only heal via rotten flesh. Craft rotten flesh.
	Scraps - Heal via coal and two tiers of plant. Higher exhaust.
	Cureable - can cure self to bypass some restrictions, extra life
	Outcast - villagers/iron golem
	Passive zombie - zombies in team
	TestPowers - Mining buffs, Ribcage
	Spawnpoint - Sets spawnpoint to a different location
	
KNOWN ISSUES
	"Bug" - XP drops on Zombie death
UPCOMING ADJUSTMENTS
	Water debuff
		Slipperiness in water?
		Damage in water?
		stacking status effect?
			TLDR MUSHROOMS DONT DO WELL IN WATER
	Cureable Rework
	ADD SPIDER EYES TO SCRAPS
	Astral - drown zombie if it falls in water too long
	Soul Seep Damage
	Mining Buff Finalization
		Minecarts?
		Mining ++?
		Mining Beam?
	Potential weird buff - craftable lingering potions (w/o Dragon's Breath?)

-----
A DIFFERENT ORIGIN IDEA

ANDROID


Lightning Rod - Can't wear helmets, must wear lightning rod receiver.
Fuel
	Can eat all fuel items and receive fuel from them
	WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU RUN OUT? THINK, MARK, THINK!
Repair health via Ores - Iron, gold, Copper mainly.
Sink in water

----
Test run
Okay. Bug #1. Didn't activate it on origin chosen
Coal - great. But, noticeably, the higher up values are unbalanced - coal block is much too strong if I want a constant struggle for resources. Consider equalizing the variables. Possibly just block them.
Low Power mode toggle - for when I'm chilling waiting for things to smelt


HEAT

Increases over time in the nether or near lava.
Decreases over time otherwise
But how would you counteract it?
	Vent - Sneak + button to blast hot air, pushing entities away? idk
		Which could be counted as an explosion, perhaps.

Inventory slot 3: Refuel inventory
	Items in here are automatically consumed for fuel
Inventory slot 4: Smelting inventory
	Items in here are automatically cooked

REMOVE BOATS
